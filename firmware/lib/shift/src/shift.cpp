/*
Public Invention's Ox Project is an open source hardware design for an oxygen
concentrator for use by field hospitals around the world. This team aims to
design an oxygen concentrator that can be manufactured locally while overcoming
challenges posed by human resources, hospital location (geographically),
infrastructure and logistics; in addition, this project attempts the minimum
documentation expected of their design for international approval whilst
tackling regulatory requirements for medical devices. Copyright (C) 2021
