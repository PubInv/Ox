  This file exists to be an interface to the Sanyo Ace B97 24-volt
  4-wire fan, document here:
  https://docs.rs-online.com/1c09/0900766b816e68bb.pdf

  This file was copypastaed from DeltaFans, a slightly different fan.

  We probably should create a generic class for these fans but
  they very enough that it may not be worth it at present.

  Tom Taylor of AmOx sent in this statement about the CFC:

  "The fan should be set to 60% during ramp up and ramp down,
  but it can be throttled back at operating temperature to
  increase power efficiency of the system. We have found blower
  values higher than 60% too high for the 1,000W heater
  present in the system. A setting of 100% is too much for the heater
  to keep up with and it will never make it to operating
  temperature. Lower values can make the stack delta too high during ramp up."

  This raises the questions should we encode in this file the 60% limit,
  and have interpret the scripted value to be 0-100% of 60%. I am
  inclined to do this for safety, but it means the fan will be
  less contollable than it would be. I will try to make that
  clear in the code.
