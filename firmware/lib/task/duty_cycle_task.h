/*
  This whole class might seem like overkill;
  why do something so complicated that resemble's
  Bresenham's line drawing algorithm when PWM would work?
  SSR only turn off on a zero-crossing (usually). Since
  the AC frequency is 60 Hz, this is MUCH slower than
  our PWM frequency of 2500 Hz typical of an Arduino.
  It is very unclear to me what would happen if you
  tried to control an SSR with a PWM signal. - rlr
