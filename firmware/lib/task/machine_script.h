/*
  The MachineScript class depends strongly on the MachineConfig.
  The purpose of a MachineScript is to manage an "experiment"
  from warmup up to operating to cooldown to off. This may
  someday also script full, long duration operational modes.
  Our basic principles are:
  1) There is one (or zero) MachineScripts operating, and this
  changes atomically (via a pointer.)
  2) The MachineScripts do not change the basic FSA defining
  the legal states (though it may internally keep sub-states,
  for exmaple, to warm up with different regimes.)
  3) The MachineScript can induce state transitions, in
  particular at particular points in time. It cannot, however,
  interrupt safety-critical shutdown states.
  4) Although our initial intention is taht the MachineScript
  will be ready from a fixed serverd via UDP, the
  MachineScript class is independent of this.
