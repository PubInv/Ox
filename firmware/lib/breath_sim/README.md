Public Invention's Ox Project is an open source hardware design for an oxygen
concentrator for use by field hospitals around the world. This team aims to
design an oxygen concentrator that can be manufactured locally while overcoming
challenges posed by human resources, hospital location (geographically),
infrastructure and logistics; in addition, this project attempts the minimum
documentation expected of their design for international approval whilst
tackling regulatory requirements for medical devices. Copyright (C) 2021

# Breath Sim

Breath Sim is a numerical, non-linear, realtime respiratory simulator that implements the model from Marconi et al. This model uses the popular concept of simulating human physiology using electrical circuits. The Boost numerical ODE solver library is used to implement the Runge-Kutta methods - the intial implementation uses the Dormand-Prince solver.
