#File description

These are the files after JLCPCB modidifed them and sent back to Lee in email on 20231016 6:59 AM


Hi there


Nice to talk with you online.

Please kindly find attached modified ok files to proceed, as well as the video about how we modified(remove all the space infront and after the characters; follow C1-11 rule for example. )ï»¿

I also received a "not match error", but after I click the "continue" button, it works:

You may have a try ~



Even after loading these modifed files into the order there was an error but I(Lee) proceeded  and placed the order.

The price went up comparied to the previously loaded files and so I thinkn the part parsing was more correct. On reviewing the component placement there were more components than on my previous review.
