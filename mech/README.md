## Mechanical Files

* The "frontpanel" folder has FreeCAD drawing which generate the DXF and other files for fabrication of the frontpanel, bottompanel and rear panel.
* The "enclosure" folder has an OpenSCAD drawing of the Unit 1 enclosure. With in the folder is a folder "FreeCADAssy" which has a FreeCAD drawing using the A2plus work bench and duplicates roughly the Unit 1 assembly but which has the Unit 2 frontpanel, bottompanel and rear panel files.

## Front Panel and Enclosure Folders  Unit 2
Place holder for July-August 2023 Begin Construction of Unit 2. 

* Goal: Mimimal design changes from Unit 1. Possible retrofit to Unit 1 of any changes.
* Fabrication of Version 2 unit Frontpanel, Bottompanel and Rearpanel not by hand in house. 
* The Frontpanel Version 2 has enlarged AC receiptical opehnings and will require reciptical cover plates.


## Front Panel and Enclosure Folders  Unit 1
A March 2023 enclosure for prototyping, proof of concept for the COG controller. 
This prototype has:
* A programmable power supply (Voltage and current), 
* Solid state relays for switching AC power to preheaters
* Power and PWM control for fans to force air into the COG
* Air Temperature and air flow rate sensors
* An Arduino Due for system control.
Navigate into the folders to see more.
