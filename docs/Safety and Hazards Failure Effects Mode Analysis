In evaluation of proper control of an ODECOS and CFC, the following hazards need to be considered
- Uncontrolled oxygen production
  -- leaking pipes or cracked stacks could cause excessive O2 build up in enclosed spaces
  -- could cause excessive oxygen levels in enclosed spaces
- Thermal runaway
  -- damage to property and equipment
  -- possible ignition source for accelerant gasses such as O2
- Electrical shock hazard
  -- person and equipment hazard
- Oxygen depleted waste exaust gas
--  OSHA dictates that the minimum "safe level" of oxygen in a confined space is 19.5%, while the maximum "safe level" of oxygen in a confined space is 23.5%. 
  With low oxygen levels being the biggest cause of death in confined spaces, accurate oxygen level measurements are essential.
- Excessive ambient temperatures
  -- can cause over temperatures on the heat exchanger
  -- can cause an over temeprature on a hot water exchanger
  -- can cause fire hazards for other devices and materials in the ajoined enclosed space.


Resolutions
-  Uncontrolled oxygen production 
  -- a well functioning controller that monitors pressure and meters O2 production satisfies this condition during normal operation
  -- Disabling the stack power supply and the stack heater will eliminate the systems ability to make oxygen 
  -- In an ideal world, a sepearate system would monitor over pressure events on the output O2 stream and could disable the systems ability to make O2 through an electrical signal
  -- a controller function watchdog/fault detection circuit would also satisfy this condition
- Thermal Runaway
  -- A well functoning controller that is monitoring temperature satisfies this condition during normal operation
  -- A thermal fuse on the stacks or on critical components tied to the Estop circuit would fulfill this requriement
  -- a controller function watchdog/fault detection circuit would also satisfy this condition
- Electrical shock hazard
  -- Metallic enclosure and all metal have a reliable connection to ground 
      -- these usually mean a gas tight and dedicated pathway to ground for all metal components
  -- A Ground fault and/or arc fault external protection in addtion to reliably grounding metallic components satisifes this condition
- Oxygen depleted waste exaust gas
  -- External Oxygen Deficiency Monitor for O2 Depletion Safety 0-25%   
  -- a normally closed relay could trigger an e-stop  and satisfy this condition
- Excessive ambient temperatures    
  -- An ambient temperature sensor on the inlet and on the surface of the pcb, in conjunction to a relay tied to an estop should satisfy this condition
  -- a thermal fuse on the inlet temperature should also satisfy this condition
  -- a controller that monitors inlet and ambient temperature should satisfy this condition


Controller safety features
- The controller is designed such that on loss of control of the DUE or loss of power, the controller produces a condition that is intrinsically safe and disables production of oxygen
